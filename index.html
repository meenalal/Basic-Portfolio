        <p>Successful Projects Begin With The Right Development Team.
        How can I help?
        <br>
            A front-end developer's role is to combine design and business logic to achieve a user-facing product. To do this successfully, a wide skill set is necessary to produce a quality user experience
        that leads to meeting business goals. With my experience I can:
        Create responsive websites that work on a wide range of devices
        Assist with production of clean and functional design
        Bridge communication gap between designers and developers
        Integrate your website into an easy to use content management system.</p>
